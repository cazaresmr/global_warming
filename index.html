    <h2>What is Global Warming? </h2>
    <p>Global Warming is a rapid increase in the average temperature of the world's Atmosphere and its oceans. Which is causing permanent change to the earth's climate.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>The Background </h2>
    <p> It was first known to humans after the industrial revolution occurred. That's when scientists started to keep track and their data showed how dramatically the globe's temperature increased. Today's scientists are studying and focusing on global temperatures and have predicted that by the year 2100 it will increase up to 1.4 or 5.8 F. This is caused by the Greenhouse Effect, when gasses that are being released by factories, burning of fossil fuels, carbon dioxide, and other gasses being released in the air, reach the atmosphere. The gasses get trapped and then get turned into heat, the atmosphere heats up more than what it's supposed to and causes the temperature of the globe to rise. That's how climate change gets involved, but climate change and global warming are similar but at the same time very different. It affects the globe in several ways by melting ice, drying out already-arid areas, causing extreme weather, and disrupting the balance of the ocean. There's a great number of people in the world that think it’s not real and it's nothing serious to worry about but in reality, it is.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>The Effects</h2>
    <p>Global Warming just causes the globe to warm up but climate change is known as the one causing more damage even though they work very similarly.<a id="quote-link"href="https://www.myclimate.org/information/faq/faq-detail/what-are-the-effects-of-climate-change/"target="_blank">  "Climate change destabilizes the Earth’s temperature equilibrium and has far-reaching effects on human beings and the environment. During global warming, the energy balance and thus the temperature of the earth change, due to the increased concentration of greenhouse gases, which has a significant impact on humans and the environment."</a><br> <strong> List of the effects:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Increase In Average Temperatures</li>
      <li>Extreme Weather Events</li>
      <li>Glaciers Melting At A Faster Rate </li>
      <li>Sea levels Raising</li>
      <li>Ocean Is Becoming More Acidic</li>
      <li>Air Polution / Dirtier air</li>
      <li>More Wilde Fires Occurring</li>
      <li>Endangering The Aquatic Life </li>
      <li>Having Droughts</li>
      <li>Plants/herbs Not Reproducing</li>
      <li>High Human Death Rates</li>
      <li>Animal Extinction </li>
      <li>Homes Being Abandoned Due To Rising Sea Levels</li>
      <li>Unexpected Weather In Certain Areas</li>
      <li>Livestock Decrease / Agricultural Decrease</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Are there Any Solutions?</h2>
    <p>Yes and no, but there are ways to help it slow down from becoming worse. We should start using less energy across the world. Switching to compact fluorescent light bulbs or Led light bulbs that use less energy than other light bulbs and they're cheaper. When driving we should use fewer miles because gas is one of the emissions that causes the greenhouse effect. The world should work together to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. When buying a car choose one that has the highest mileage and is a gas saver. When buying home products like washers, dryers always look for one that has the government energy star label. The government energy star label uses less energy and it saves you money too. Speaking up is another solution that can spread the word to people across the world. Starting organizations where everyone can start working together to help reduce global warming. Passing new laws that are powerful so that people can understand why global warming is terrible and can prevent us from using too much energy and releasing too many greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere.</p>
